description: Create, migrate, audit, and repair AI-assisted project scaffolding for TypeScript/React/Node-style repos. Use whenever the user wants to initialize a new project, generate or update CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md, migrate an existing repo to a tasks-first workflow, add repo-local task sync contracts, or audit an AI coding setup for Claude and Codex compatibility. Trigger even when the user only mentions "set up the repo", "fix AGENTS.md", "add task sync", "migrate Claude Code config", "generate CLAUDE.md", or "make this project ready for AI-assisted development."

# anicenttwo-proj-init

Build or modernize a repository so it works as an AI-assisted coding project with:

- stack-aware initialization
- concise `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` routing files
- repo-local `tasks/` contracts
- migration helpers for older repos
- reference configs and workflow scripts

Treat this skill as a router. Keep `SKILL.md` focused on when to use the skill and which path to follow. Load detailed references only when needed.

## Choose the right path

Start by deciding which of these four workflows matches the user request:

1. **Initialize a new project**
   - Use when the user wants a new React, TypeScript, Node, Remix, Expo, monorepo, or adjacent project scaffold.
2. **Migrate an existing repo**
   - Use when the user already has a repository and wants to adopt the latest AI workflow, hooks, templates, or tasks-first contract.
3. **Audit an AI workflow**
   - Use when the repo exists and the user wants a review of `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, hooks, tasks files, or repo-local workflow enforcement.
4. **Repair task-sync or contract drift**
   - Use when the user says Codex or Claude is not updating `tasks/*`, `PROGRESS.md` is being misused, or the repo contract has drifted.

## Capture intent before generating

Extract as much as possible from the conversation first, then fill the gaps:

- project type and stack
- whether the repo is new or existing
- whether the user needs generation, migration, or audit
- target agents: Claude, Codex, or both
- acceptance criteria for the scaffold or migration

When the repo already exists, inspect it before asking questions. Determine whether the problem is:

- missing files
- stale templates
- hook-only enforcement without repo-local contract
- outdated `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` guidance
- migration drift between generated files and current conventions

## Core operating rules

- Prefer repo-local contracts over agent-specific hooks.
- Generate `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, `tasks/research.md`, and `tasks/contracts/` as the default workflow surface.
- Treat `docs/PROGRESS.md` as milestone-only, not as the day-to-day execution log.
- Make Claude hooks an enhancement layer, not the sole source of enforcement.
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` concise; route detail into `docs/reference-configs/*`.
- Keep stack-specific details in assets and references, not duplicated in the main skill body.

## New project workflow

For a new project:

1. Infer defaults from the plan map and question pack.
2. Confirm only the decisions that materially affect the generated project.
3. Assemble concise `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
4. Generate tasks-first workflow files and helper scripts.
5. Generate reference configs and stack docs.
6. Make sure the repo includes repo-local task sync enforcement.

### Plan index

Core Plans (A-F):
- Plan A: Remix
- Plan B: UmiJS + Ant Design Pro
- Plan C: Vite + TanStack Router
- Plan D: Bun + Turborepo
- Plan E: Astro landing page

Custom Presets (G-K):
- Plan G: AI quantitative trading
- Plan H: Financial trading / FIX / RFQ
- Plan I: Web3 DApp
- Plan J: AI coding agent / TUI
- Plan K: Fully custom configuration

## Existing repo migration workflow

For migration requests:

1. Inspect current repo structure, especially:
   - `CLAUDE.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `.claude/settings.json`
   - `docs/PROGRESS.md`
   - `tasks/`
   - helper scripts under `scripts/`
2. Identify drift from the current tasks-first contract.
3. Use `scripts/migrate-project-template.sh` when the user wants repo-wide migration.
4. Preserve user-owned content where possible; prefer additive migration over destructive replacement unless the user asks to reset.
5. If the repo has hooks but lacks repo-local task enforcement, treat that as incomplete migration.

Read `references/migration-guide.md` before changing migration behavior.

## Audit and repair workflow

For audits or contract repairs:

1. Compare current repo behavior against the generated contract.
2. Check whether both Codex and Claude can follow the same `tasks/` workflow.
3. Flag these issues first:
   - `docs/PROGRESS.md` used as active task log
   - final response contract missing task-file disclosure
   - task-sync enforced only through hooks
   - `AGENTS.md` mentions `tasks/*` but does not require syncing them
4. Recommend repo-local enforcement first, then hook enhancements second.

If the user wants implementation, update templates, scripts, migration paths, and tests together.

## Outputs this skill owns

The skill can generate or maintain:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/brief.md`
- `docs/tech-stack.md`
- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- `tasks/todo.md`
- `tasks/lessons.md`
- `tasks/research.md`
- `tasks/contracts/*`
- `docs/reference-configs/*.md`
- workflow helpers under `scripts/`

Conditional outputs remain plan-specific:

- `docs/packages.md` for monorepos
- `docs/guides/metro-esm-gotchas.md` for Expo
- Cloudflare deployment notes for cloudflare-native plans

## Evaluation and iteration

This skill is expected to be benchmarked and iterated like a product, not just edited by feel.

Use `evals/evals.json` as the canonical prompt set for:

- new project initialization
- AGENTS/CLAUDE regeneration
- old repo migration to tasks-first contracts
- audit and repair of AI workflow drift

Benchmark conventions, iteration directories, and review flow live in:

- `references/evaluation-playbook.md`

Use the local runner for lightweight repo-owned benchmark passes:

- `bun run benchmark:skills --dry-run`
- `bun run benchmark:skills --eval repair-agents-task-sync`

Do not vendor the upstream `skill-creator` runner or viewer into this repo. Keep this repo ready to work with external evaluation workflows while owning only the minimal local orchestration needed for iteration.

## Validation checklist

When you change this skill, validate the relevant layer:

- template assembly tests for `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
- bootstrap and migration tests for generated files
- task-sync tests for repo-local contract enforcement
- eval asset validation for `evals/evals.json`
- version consistency checks against `package.json` and `assets/skill-version.json`

## Troubleshooting

- Unsure which plan to use: start with core plans A-F.
- Unsure whether to prefer hooks or repo contracts: prefer repo contracts.
- Unsure whether to update `docs/PROGRESS.md`: only update it for milestones.
- Unsure whether to add more detail to `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`: move detail into `docs/reference-configs/*`.
