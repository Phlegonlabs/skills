## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Research Before Planning
- Deeply read relevant code paths and persist findings to `tasks/research.md`.
- Capture hidden contracts, edge cases, and integration risks before proposing changes.

### 2. Annotation Cycle
- Iterate plan updates directly in `plans/plan-*.md` via inline notes.
- Do not implement while plan status is `Draft` or `Annotating`.

### 3. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks.
- Re-plan when execution drifts.

### 4. Subagent Strategy
- Offload independent research tracks.
- Keep one ownership boundary per subagent.

### 5. Self-Improvement Loop
- Append correction-derived rules to `tasks/lessons.md`.

### 6. Verification Before Done
- No task completion without test/build evidence.

### 6b. Contract Verification
- Define per-task contract files in `tasks/contracts/`.
- Verify contract exit criteria before claiming completion.
- Use `scripts/verify-contract.sh --contract tasks/contracts/{slug}.contract.md --strict`.

### 7. Balanced Elegance
- Redesign hacky non-trivial fixes before shipping.

### 8. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- Start fixing when logs/tests provide sufficient evidence.

### 9. Spa Day
- Periodically consolidate conflicting rules and stale references.
- Follow `docs/reference-configs/spa-day-protocol.md` for cleanup cadence.
