## Workflow Rules

- Prefer modifying existing files over adding new files.
- {{RUNTIME_MODE}} by default for file mutations.
- Primary worktree warns by default; enforce via `.claude/.require-worktree`.
- Commit after green checks with atomic checkpoint discipline.
- Keep execution contracts in `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`.
