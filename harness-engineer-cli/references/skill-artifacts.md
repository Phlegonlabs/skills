## Artifact Generation Rules

### AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md (Identical Content)

These two files have **the same content**. Generate one, copy to the other.
AGENTS.md is for Codex. CLAUDE.md is for Claude Code. Same rules, no divergence.

#### What is TEMPLATED (copy verbatim into every project):

Only the Iron Rules section is fixed:

```
## Iron Rules — Non-Negotiable

These rules are absolute. No exceptions. No workarounds. No "just this once."

### 1. 500-Line Hard Ceiling + Proactive Modularization
No single **source code file** may exceed 500 lines. But don't wait until 500 — split
proactively. If a file is approaching ~250 lines and has more than one responsibility,
extract a module NOW. Every file should have a single, clear purpose.

**Proactive split triggers (act on ANY of these):**
- File has 2+ unrelated sections → extract to separate modules
- File has functions used by multiple other files → move to a shared module
- A single function exceeds ~80 lines → extract helpers or decompose
- You're adding a new feature to an existing file and it'll push past ~300 lines → new module
- A component renders AND fetches data AND handles state → split by concern
- The harness CLI itself follows this rule: entry point ~50 lines, 6 focused modules, each <350 lines

**How to decompose:**
- Group by domain/responsibility, not by file type (don't put all types in one file)
- Each module exports a clear, minimal API — internal helpers stay private
- Prefer deep module trees (modules/auth/service.ts, modules/auth/routes.ts) over flat ones
- Re-export from index.ts barrel files when the module API is stable

**Documentation files are exempt from the 500-line limit.** These files may
(and often will) exceed 500 lines — do NOT split them:
- `docs/PRD.md` — grows with the project
- `docs/PLAN.md` — grows with each sprint
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — must stay in one file (agents read them whole)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/site/*.md`, `docs/learnings.md`, any file under `docs/`

If `PLAN.md` grows past ~1000 lines, archive completed execution plan files to
`docs/exec-plans/completed/` rather than splitting the file. The CLI handles this
automatically via `worktree:finish` when a milestone completes.
When upgrading an older project to a newer harness runtime, run `harness migrate`
once from main/root to backfill the exec-plan folders and schema.
`harness migrate` does not rewrite AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md or workflow prose.

### 2. Zero Compatibility Code
No polyfills. No shims. No backward-compat wrappers.
Write for the target runtime and version in project config. Period.
If a dependency requires compat hacks, replace the dependency.

### 3. Conflict = Delete and Rebuild
If a module conflicts with existing code — type mismatches, circular deps, API surface
disagreements — do NOT patch around it. Delete and rebuild from scratch.
Code is cheap. Tokens are infinite. Architectural clarity is priceless.

### 4. First Principles Programming
Every function, module, and abstraction must justify its existence from first principles.
Ask: What is this actually trying to do? What is the simplest correct way?
If you can't explain the WHY in one sentence, the code shouldn't exist.

### 5. Frontend = Always Use frontend-design Skill
When generating any frontend code (components, pages, layouts, styles), ALWAYS read
and follow `docs/frontend-design.md` first. This file is bundled in the project.
No exceptions. Even for "small" UI changes.

### 6. Secrets Never Touch Git
.env files are NEVER committed. Not even "example" values that look like real keys.
- `.env` is in .gitignore from day zero — non-negotiable
- `.env.example` contains only KEY_NAME=placeholder pairs, never real values
- All secrets load from environment variables at runtime, never hardcoded
- If you see a string that looks like a key/token/password in source code, extract it to env immediately

### 7. Production Ready Standard
Every milestone must be shippable. Code that "works on my machine" is not done.
- Error handling: every external call (API, DB, file I/O) has try/catch or error boundary
- Input validation: every endpoint/command validates input before processing
- Logging: every error is logged with context (request ID, user, operation)
- No console.log in production code — use structured logger
- No hardcoded URLs, ports, or credentials — all from env/config
- No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments — if it's not fixed, it's a task in PLAN.md
- Tests cover the happy path AND at least one error path per function
- Build produces zero warnings (not just zero errors)
- README/docs accurately describe what the code actually does right now
```

#### What is DYNAMICALLY GENERATED (unique to each project):

Everything else must be written fresh from the user's actual project context.
DO NOT use generic placeholders. DO NOT copy from the template — write it.

Dynamically generate these sections:

- **Project overview** — What THIS project does, its stack, its purpose. From the PRD.
- **Quick start** — Real commands for THIS project's package manager and stack.
  e.g., `bun install && bun dev` not "install deps and run dev server"
  Include `docker-compose up -d` if Docker is configured.
- **Repository map** — Pointers to the actual docs in THIS project.
- **Architecture rules** — Dependency layers, module boundaries, import restrictions
  specific to THIS project's domain. Derived from ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **Error handling conventions** — Point to `src/lib/errors.ts`, explain the error
  class hierarchy. "All errors thrown in application code must extend AppError."
- **Logging conventions** — "Use the structured logger from `src/lib/logger.ts`.
  Never use console.log in production code."
- **Feature flag conventions** — "Every new user-facing feature ships behind a flag.
  Check `src/lib/feature-flags.ts`. Remove flag when feature is stable."
- **Analytics conventions** — "Use `trackEvent()` from `src/lib/analytics.ts`.
  Never call GA/Posthog directly."
- **Dev environment tips** — Real tips for THIS stack. pnpm project gets pnpm commands.
  Go project gets Go tips. Include Docker commands if applicable.
- **Testing instructions** — The full testing loop for THIS project. Include:
  - The exact `lint:fix`, `lint`, `type-check`, `test`, `validate` commands
  - How to run a single test file or test case
  - The rule: run `validate` before EVERY commit, no exceptions
- **Deploy instructions** — How to deploy THIS project to the chosen target.
  Actual commands, not generic advice.
- **PR conventions** — Scope names from THIS project's actual modules/domains.

- **Plan File Convention** — Where plan files go (critical for Codex compatibility):

```
## Plan Files

All plan files MUST be written to `docs/exec-plans/active/`.

For Claude Code: this is handled automatically via .claude/settings.json (plansDirectory).
For Codex: when creating a plan, ALWAYS write it to `docs/exec-plans/active/<descriptive-name>.md`.
  Do NOT write plans to ~/.codex/ or any other location outside the project.

Naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-description>.md`
Example: `2026-03-08-add-user-profile-editing.md`

### Adding New Work — Full Flow

1. Enter plan mode (Shift+Tab) → discuss requirements with the user
2. Before writing the plan, run: `<pkg-mgr> run harness plan:status`
   This shows: current milestones, progress, what's done/active, next available M number
3. Write the plan to docs/exec-plans/active/ using PLAN.md milestone format:

   ### M1: Feature Name
   **Status:** ⬜ Not Started
   | Task ID | Story | Task | Done When | Status | Commit |
   |---------|-------|------|-----------|--------|--------|
   | M1-001  | —     | ...  | ...       | ⬜     | —      |

   Use any milestone numbering (M1, M2...) — plan:apply auto-renumbers to avoid conflicts.
   If the plan needs architecture changes, document them in the plan file as prose above the tables.

4. If this project uses the TypeScript CLI (`scripts/harness.ts`), run:
   `<pkg-mgr> run harness plan:apply`
   The CLI automatically:
   - Reads all unsynced plan files
   - Analyzes current project state (completed, active, pending milestones)
   - Renumbers milestones to avoid conflicts (M1 in plan → M5 in project if M4 exists)
   - Resolves dependencies (same apply batch auto-chains in order unless explicit deps override it)
   - Appends milestones to PLAN.md with correct headers (Status, Branch, Worktree, Depends on)
   - Updates progress.json (active_milestones, per-task mirrors, dependency_graph, synced_plans, finish_jobs)
   - Marks plan file as synced

5. Then run: `<pkg-mgr> run harness worktree:start M<next>`
   The CLI creates worktree → installs → inits → auto-starts first task.

If this project uses the native shell CLI (`scripts/harness.sh` with no Node.js):
- Still write the plan file to `docs/exec-plans/active/`
- Manually copy the milestone tables into `docs/PLAN.md`
- Manually update `docs/progress.json` (`active_milestones`, task mirrors, `dependency_graph`)
- Run `bash scripts/harness.sh init`, then `next` / `start` to enter the task loop
- Do NOT instruct the agent to run `plan:apply`, `worktree:*`, or expect auto-archive

After a TypeScript CLI plan is applied, the file stays in exec-plans/active/ as reference.
When every milestone defined in that file is completed, `worktree:finish` auto-moves it to
`exec-plans/completed/`. The native shell CLI does not automate that archive step.
```

- **Scaffold Templates (CLI)** — When adding new capabilities mid-project, use the
  harness CLI to inject templates. DO NOT search the web blindly:

```
## Scaffold Templates — harness scaffold <type>

When the project needs to add a new capability layer (agent tools, skills, deployment config),
the CLI has built-in templates. These are production-ready patterns, not generic boilerplate.

DO NOT search the web for "how to build MCP server" or "SKILL.md format".
Run the CLI command — it generates the right files adapted to this project.

| Need | Command | What it generates |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Expose API as agent tools | `harness scaffold mcp` | `src/tools/`, `src/server.ts`, transport config, test skeleton |
| Make project discoverable | `harness scaffold skill` | `SKILL.md` at project root (OpenClaw / claude.ai compatible) |
| Generate LLM index | `harness scaffold llms-txt` | `llms.txt` (llmstxt.org spec) — auto-scans project files |
| A2A agent-to-agent discovery | `harness scaffold agent-card` | `/.well-known/agent.json` (Google A2A protocol) |
| Tool observability | `harness scaffold agent-observe` | `src/lib/tool-metrics.ts` — call count, latency, errors |
| Auth + rate limiting | `harness scaffold agent-auth` | `src/middleware/auth.ts` — Bearer token + per-key rate limit |
| Payment layer | `harness scaffold agent-pay` | x402 (HTTP 402 micropayments) + Stripe metered billing |
| MCP protocol tests | `harness scaffold agent-test` | Integration tests for full MCP lifecycle + error handling |
| Schema drift CI | `harness scaffold agent-schema-ci` | CI script comparing SKILL.md tools vs code registry |
| Tool versioning docs | `harness scaffold agent-version` | `docs/tool-versioning.md` — v1/v2, deprecation flow |
| Multi-agent client | `harness scaffold agent-client` | `src/lib/agent-client.ts` — discover + call remote agents |
| MCP Prompts | `harness scaffold agent-prompts` | `src/prompts/index.ts` — pre-built prompt templates |
| Webhook / long tasks | `harness scaffold agent-webhook` | `src/lib/task-queue.ts` — async tasks + callback pattern |
| Cost tracking | `harness scaffold agent-cost` | `src/lib/cost-tracker.ts` — per-call cost + audit log |
| Pre-built agent milestone | `harness scaffold milestone:agent` | Appends 11-task MCP milestone to PLAN.md + progress.json |
| Cloudflare Workers config | `harness scaffold cloudflare` | `wrangler.toml` (D1/KV/R2), `.dev.vars`, CI deploy |

How to use:
1. Enter plan mode → discuss what you want to add
2. Run: <pkg-mgr> run harness scaffold <type>
3. CLI generates files → you review + adapt to project specifics
4. Create a plan/milestone for the remaining work (wire up routes, implement tools, etc.)
5. Resume normal Task Execution Loop

Multiple scaffolds can be combined:
  <pkg-mgr> run harness scaffold mcp
  <pkg-mgr> run harness scaffold skill
  <pkg-mgr> run harness scaffold milestone:agent
```

- **Session Init Protocol** — What the agent does FIRST when starting:

```
## Session Init — Do This First, Every Time

Run: <pkg-mgr> run harness init

This automatically cascades through the full startup sequence:
1. Syncs any new plan files from docs/exec-plans/active/
2. If running on main/root and unsynced plans have milestone tables → auto plan:apply (inserts into PLAN.md)
3. If running inside a worktree and new plans exist → warns and defers plan:apply to main/root
4. Runs stale detection + milestone closeout recovery
5. Prints current status (milestone, task, blockers, progress)
6. If in a worktree with no current task → auto next → auto start (claims first available)
7. If NOT in a worktree and there's a pending milestone → prints worktree:start command

After init, the CLI tells the agent exactly what to do:
  "Started: M3-004 — Add chart components. Write code, then run: harness validate"

Then load memory (agent does this, not the CLI):
- Read docs/memory/MEMORY.md — long-term project memory
- Read docs/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday) — recent session context
- If resuming a task: check the daily log for "In Progress" section

Context budget:
- Use the canonical budget in `references/execution-runtime.md#Context Budget`
- Do not maintain a second budget table here
- Overloaded? → write notes to daily log, commit what works, start fresh session.

After init, proceed DIRECTLY to writing code. Do not wait for user confirmation.
```

- **Task Execution Loop** — The agent only does 3 things in a loop:
  1. Write code
  2. `harness validate` + `git commit`
  3. `harness done <id>`
  
  Everything else is auto-cascaded by the CLI. Do NOT manually run `next` or `start`.

```
## Task Execution Loop

The CLI auto-chains commands. The agent's loop is simple:

  # 1. Write code for the current task (init already started it)

  # 2. Validate + commit
  <pkg-mgr> run harness validate
  git add -A && git commit -m "[M1-003] <what you did>"

  # 3. Mark done — CLI auto-cascades:
  <pkg-mgr> run harness done M1-003
  #   → ✅ PLAN.md + progress.json updated (including tasks[] array)
  #   → git checkout . (clean working tree)
  #   → auto next (find next unblocked task)
  #   → auto start (claim it → 🟡)
  #   → prints: "Started: M1-004 — Implement login. Write code, then run: harness validate"
  #
  # If no more tasks → full auto-chain:
  #   → auto merge-gate (validate:full + stale-check + changelog)
  #   → if green → queue root-side worktree:finish (rebase → merge → archive → push → cleanup)
  #   → auto worktree:start next milestone (install → init → start M2-001)
  #   → prints: "Started: M2-001 — ..."
  #   → Agent continues writing code. Zero manual steps between milestones.
  #
  # If all tasks blocked → prints blockers, waits for human

  # Write a brief note to docs/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md after each task
  # (1-2 lines: what was done, any gotchas)

  # 4. Repeat — write code for the next task (already started by done's auto-cascade)

If validate fails 3x:
  <pkg-mgr> run harness block M1-003 "reason"
  <pkg-mgr> run harness learn <category> "what went wrong"
  # block auto-cascades: → auto next → auto start next unblocked task
  # Agent continues with the next task without manual intervention.

## Milestone Transition

When the last task is done, the CLI auto-runs merge-gate and, on success, queues a
root-side `worktree:finish` from the main repo:

  # done M1-007 auto-triggers this chain after merge-gate passes:
  #   → root-side serialized worktree:finish queue receives M1
  #   → rebase + merge + archive completed exec plan + push + remove worktree
  #   → AUTO: worktree:start M2 (create + install + init + start M2-001)
  #   → "Started: M2-001 — ..."

The agent does not need to manually close a milestone under the normal flow.

If the agent forgets to merge and starts a new session:
  harness init  ← detects: all tasks ✅ but milestone not merged
  #   → auto-finish from main root
  #   → does NOT auto-start new tasks — forces merge first

## What the agent NEVER needs to manually run:
  - harness next              ← auto-called by done
  - harness start <id>        ← auto-called by done (and by init)
  - harness merge-gate        ← auto-called by done when milestone complete
  - harness worktree:finish   ← auto-queued by merge-gate after milestone completion
  - harness worktree:start    ← auto-called by worktree:finish for next milestone
  - harness plan:apply        ← auto-called by init only on main/root when new plans detected
  - harness recover           ← auto-called by init
```

- **Merge Gate** — When all tasks in a milestone are ✅:

```
## Milestone Merge Gate

<pkg-mgr> run harness merge-gate

This runs: validate:full + stale-check + changelog.
If green inside a worktree, the CLI queues root-side finish automatically.
Tagging, if needed, is a separate post-merge release action.
```

- **Stale Detection** — Run anytime, or automatic via `harness init`:

```
## Stale Detection

<pkg-mgr> run harness stale-check

Automatically checks: .env.example sync, PLAN vs progress.json,
new modules not in ARCHITECTURE.md, unsynced plan files, dead doc links.
```

- **Idle Protocol** — What to do when all milestones are complete:

```
## Idle Protocol (all milestones complete)

When progress.json shows no active milestone and no remaining tasks:

1. Run: <pkg-mgr> run harness worktree:status  — confirm no active worktrees or pending finish jobs
2. Run: <pkg-mgr> run harness validate:full    — final green-pass on main branch
3. Run: <pkg-mgr> run harness changelog        — generate release notes from [Mn-id] commits
4. Run: <pkg-mgr> run harness schema           — confirm progress.json is valid

Report to the user:
  "All milestones are complete. Here's the changelog for this sprint.
  Based on the changes I'd suggest version X.Y.Z — please confirm or pick a different version."

WAIT for user to confirm the version. Do NOT create or push the tag yourself.

After confirmation:
  git tag v<version>
  git push --tags

Then archive any remaining exec-plans:
  mv docs/exec-plans/active/*.md docs/exec-plans/completed/
  git add -A && git commit -m "chore: archive exec-plans for v<version>"

After tagging and archiving, enter IDLE state:
- Do NOT invent new tasks or milestones
- Do NOT start new work without an explicit user request
- Wait for the user to add new work via plan mode
```

- **Adding New Work** — Plan mode → CLI handles the rest:

```
## Adding New Work

To add new work, the user enters plan mode:
- Claude Code: press Shift+Tab to enter plan mode
- Codex: switch to plan mode via the Codex UI

Describe what to build. The plan file saves to docs/exec-plans/active/.
Exit plan mode, then run:

<pkg-mgr> run harness init

The CLI detects the new plan. Parse it into PLAN.md + progress.json,
then resume the Task Execution Loop.

For tiny changes: just tell the agent to create a task directly.
```

- **Git Workflow** — Worktree per milestone rules (the workflow is standard but
  project name, branch names, and commands should use the real project name):

```
## Git Workflow — Worktree per Milestone

### Branch Strategy
Each milestone in PLAN.md gets its own git worktree and branch.
The CLI enforces this — task commands (next/start/done) refuse to run on main.

# From main repo root:
<pkg-mgr> run harness worktree:start M<n>
# → creates worktree, installs deps, runs init, auto-starts first task when possible

# All work happens here with atomic commits
# Task commands only work inside a worktree — not on main

# Periodically rebase onto main (especially after other milestones merge):
<pkg-mgr> run harness worktree:rebase

# When complete and all tests pass:
<pkg-mgr> run harness done M<n-last-task>
# → auto-runs merge-gate
# → queues root-side worktree:finish
# → checks dependency order (blocks if deps not merged)
# → rebases onto main (reports conflicts if any)
# → merges, archives completed exec plans, pushes, cleans up worktree

### Atomic Commits
Every task follows this exact loop. No shortcuts. No skipping steps.

1. Write or modify code for ONE task
2. Run lint with auto-fix: <lint-fix-command>
3. If lint auto-fix changed files → review changes, stage them
4. Run lint check (no fix): <lint-check-command>
5. If lint errors remain → fix manually, go to step 4
6. Run type-check: <type-check-command>
7. If type errors → fix, go to step 4
8. Run relevant test(s): <test-command>
9. If tests fail → fix code, go to step 2 (full loop restart)
10. ALL green → commit immediately
11. Move to next task

Commit format: [M<n>-<task_id>] <what changed>

NEVER commit with lint warnings, type errors, or failing tests.
The loop restarts from step 2 on ANY failure — no partial fixes.

### Parallel Milestones
Independent milestones can run in parallel (one agent per worktree).
The CLI coordinates via progress.json agents array:
- worktree:start checks no other active agent has claimed the milestone
- init registers the agent with a heartbeat (updated on every command)
- worktree:status shows all agents, heartbeats, serialized auto-finish jobs, and merge readiness
- Stale agents (heartbeat >2h) are reclaimable
- Only one root-side `worktree:finish` mutates main at a time; other ready milestones remain queued in `finish_jobs`

After another milestone merges into main, rebase your worktree:
  <pkg-mgr> run harness worktree:rebase

### Milestone Completion Checklist
Before merging back to main, run the FULL gate — every check must pass:

<lint-fix-command>              # auto-fix what it can
<lint-check-command>            # must be zero errors, zero warnings
<type-check-command>            # must be zero errors
<full-test-command>             # entire test suite must pass
<file-line-count-check>         # no file exceeds 500 lines

If ANY check fails → fix in the worktree, commit the fix, re-run ALL checks.
Only merge when every gate is green.

- [ ] Lint: zero errors, zero warnings
- [ ] Types: zero errors
- [ ] Tests: full suite passes
- [ ] No file exceeds 500 lines
- [ ] PLAN.md updated (tasks marked done, milestone status updated)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria from PRD verified for each completed story
- [ ] Completed exec plan auto-archived from `exec-plans/active/` to `exec-plans/completed/`
- [ ] Production ready: no TODO/FIXME/HACK in committed code
- [ ] Production ready: all errors handled (no unhandled promise rejections, no bare throws)
- [ ] Production ready: build produces zero warnings
- [ ] Production ready: no console.log in production paths (use logger)
```

### ARCHITECTURE.md (Dynamically Generated)

This file is the technical blueprint. Generate it entirely from the project's actual
domain structure, tech stack, and patterns. Include:

```markdown
# Architecture: <Project Name>

## Domain Map
Visual or text representation of the project's domains and how they relate.
For a web app this might be: Auth, Users, Products, Orders, Payments, Notifications.
For a CLI tool: Parser, Commands, Config, Output.
For an Agent / MCP server: Server, Tools, Resources, Prompts, API Client.
For a Desktop app: Main Process, Renderer, Preload, IPC, Shared Types.

## Dependency Layers
Strict ordering — each layer can only import from layers to its left:

Web App / API:
  Types → Config → Lib → Service → Controller/Handler → UI/CLI

CLI Tool:
  Types → Config → Lib → Commands → Entry Point

Agent / MCP:
  Types → Config → Lib → API Client → Tools/Resources → Server

Desktop (Electron):
  Shared → Preload → Main (IPC, lifecycle) | Renderer (UI)

Enforced by ESLint import rules (JS/TS) or equivalent linter. Violations fail lint.

## Package / Module Structure
Map of src/ directories to domains. Adapt to project type:

**Web App / API:**
src/
├── lib/          ← shared utilities (errors, logger, feature-flags, analytics, env)
├── modules/
│   ├── auth/     ← Auth domain (routes, service, model, tests)
│   ├── users/    ← Users domain
│   └── ...
├── middleware/    ← cross-cutting (error handler, auth guard, request logger)
└── config/       ← app config, env validation

**CLI Tool:**
src/
├── commands/     ← one file per command (init, deploy, config, etc.)
├── lib/          ← shared utilities (errors, logger, config loader, output formatters)
├── prompts/      ← interactive prompts (if applicable)
└── index.ts      ← entry point: parse args, dispatch

**Agent / MCP Server:**
src/
├── tools/        ← one file per MCP tool
├── resources/    ← MCP resources
├── prompts/      ← MCP prompt templates
├── lib/          ← shared utilities + external API clients
└── server.ts     ← MCP server entry (stdio/SSE transport)

**Desktop App (Electron):**
src/
├── main/         ← main process (Node.js — lifecycle, IPC, menus)
├── renderer/     ← renderer process (React/Vue — UI)
├── preload/      ← preload scripts (context bridge)
└── shared/       ← types shared between main and renderer

## Error Handling Pattern
- All application errors extend `AppError` from `src/lib/errors.ts`
- HTTP layer catches errors via global error middleware
- Error responses: `{ error: { code: "MACHINE_READABLE", message: "Human readable", details? } }`
- Log all errors with structured logger, never swallow silently

## Logging Pattern
- Use `src/lib/logger.ts` everywhere. Never `console.log` in production code.
- Request middleware injects `requestId` into every log entry
- Levels: debug (dev only), info (business events), warn (recoverable), error (failures)

## Feature Flag Pattern
- `src/lib/feature-flags.ts` — all new user-facing features ship behind a flag
- Flag lifecycle: create → enable for % → monitor → remove when stable
- Dead flags (enabled for 100% for >2 weeks) get cleaned up

## Analytics Pattern
- `src/lib/analytics.ts` — provider-agnostic interface
- Core events defined in a central events file
- Never call tracking provider directly — always go through the service

## Deploy Architecture
- Target: <chosen deploy target — e.g. Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, VPS (Hetzner), Fly.io, etc.>
- Method: <deployment method — e.g. Git push auto-deploy, Docker Compose + SSH, Kamal, Wrangler CLI, etc.>
- Build: <build command and output — e.g. `pnpm run build` → `.next/` or `dist/`>
- CI/CD: <pipeline provider — GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / platform auto-deploy>
- Config file: <platform config — vercel.json / wrangler.toml / fly.toml / docker-compose.yml / deploy.yml>
- Environment: <how env vars are injected — platform dashboard, .env files, Docker env, secrets manager>
- Health: /health and /health/ready endpoints
- Preview: <preview/staging deploy strategy — Vercel preview deploys / Fly.io staging app / Docker staging compose>

## Key Decisions
Link to docs/design-docs/ for detailed ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).
```

### PLAN.md — Granular Decomposition

The plan must be broken down as finely as possible. Each task should be a single
atomic unit of work — something one agent can complete in one session.

**Decomposition rules:**
- Each Epic from the PRD becomes a Milestone (or split further if the epic is large)
- Each User Story becomes a group of tasks within that milestone
- Each task must be completable in ≤ 4 hours of work
- If a task feels bigger than 4h, split it further
- Tasks must reference their parent story ID for traceability
- Every task must have a clear "done when" (from story acceptance criteria)

**Milestone granularity guidelines:**
- Prefer 5–15 tasks per milestone. More than 15 → split the milestone.
- Each milestone must be independently shippable (tests pass, lint clean)
- Dependencies between milestones must be explicit

```markdown
# Project Plan: <Project Name>

## Traceability
Requirements (PRD §4) → Epics (PRD §9) → Stories (PRD §9) → Tasks (below)

```

### SKILL.md — Agent Discovery File (MCP / Agent Tool projects only)

**Always generate SKILL.md at the project root for Agent Tool / MCP Server projects.**

This file is the discovery contract — it tells LLM agents (Claude, Codex, etc.) what this
tool does and how to use it. Without SKILL.md, agents can't discover the tool.

Structure follows the same YAML frontmatter + markdown body pattern used by claude.ai skills:

```markdown
---
name: <server-name>
description: >
  <One paragraph: what this tool does, what data/APIs it accesses, what problems it solves.
  This is what agents read to decide whether to use the tool. Be specific — not "manages data"
  but "searches and creates GitHub issues via the GitHub API".>
---

# <Server Name>

## Overview

<2-3 sentences: what this MCP server does and who/what it's for.>

## Connection

### stdio (local — Claude Desktop, Claude Code)

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<server-name>": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["<package-name>"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### SSE (remote — claude.ai, web integrations)

```
URL: https://<your-domain>/sse
```

Or add as a claude.ai connector via Settings → Connectors → Add MCP Server.

## Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `API_KEY` | API key for <service> | Yes |
| `API_BASE_URL` | Custom API endpoint (default: <default-url>) | No |

## Available Tools

### `<tool-name-1>`

<One sentence: what this tool does.>

**Input:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | Yes | Search query |
| `limit` | number | No | Max results (default: 10) |

**Output:** Array of `{ id, title, url, snippet }`

**Example:**
```json
{ "query": "login bug", "limit": 5 }
```

### `<tool-name-2>`

<One sentence: what this tool does.>

**Input:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Yes | Title of the record |
| `body` | string | No | Optional description |

**Output:** `{ id, title, created_at, url }`

<Repeat for each tool. Every tool must be listed here.>

## Available Resources (if any)

| URI Pattern | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `<server>://items/{id}` | Individual item by ID |
| `<server>://items` | List of all items |

## Error Handling

All tools return structured MCP errors:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `INVALID_PARAMS` | Missing or invalid input parameters |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Requested resource not found |
| `AUTH_ERROR` | API key missing or invalid |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | External API rate limit hit — retry after delay |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unexpected server error |

## Detailed API Reference

See [docs/api-reference.md](./docs/api-reference.md) for full JSON Schemas,
response examples, and edge case documentation.
```

**SKILL.md generation rules:**
- **Format is OpenClaw-compatible** — uses the same YAML frontmatter + markdown body pattern
  as OpenClaw's AgentSkills system. This means the generated SKILL.md works with:
  - claude.ai custom skills (upload as skill folder)
  - OpenClaw (place in `~/.openclaw/skills/` or workspace `skills/`)
  - Claude Code (place in project root — Claude Code reads it at startup)
  - Any agent framework that follows the AgentSkills convention
- **Every tool must appear** in the "Available Tools" section with input/output tables
- **Connection section** must include both stdio and SSE if the server supports both
- **Environment variables** section must list ALL required env vars — agents need this
  to configure the connection. For OpenClaw, these map to `skills.entries.<key>.env`
- **Error codes** must match the actual error codes in `src/lib/errors.ts`
- **Keep it under 200 lines** — this is a discovery file, not full documentation.
  Point to `docs/api-reference.md` for the complete reference
- **Update SKILL.md whenever tools change** — add a task to the milestone whenever
  a tool is added, renamed, or has its schema changed

**docs/api-reference.md** should contain:
- Full JSON Schema for every tool's input and output
- Example request/response pairs for each tool
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Rate limiting details (if calling external APIs)
- Authentication flow details

### Scaffold Generation

Generate actual source files appropriate to the chosen stack. Not empty dirs.

**BEFORE generating any config file, read the reference templates:**
- `references/gitignore-templates.md` — .gitignore assembled per stack
- `references/eslint-configs.md` — ESLint flat configs per framework
- `references/project-configs.md` — tsconfig, prettier, vitest, Docker, CI, Python configs
- `references/harness-cli.md` — the harness CLI, JSON Schema, git hooks, lint-staged, assembly checklist
- `references/execution-runtime.md` — agent guidelines: parallel protocol, context budget, quality gates

Never write configs or scripts from memory. Always reference these files and adapt.
The templates use the strictest settings — never downgrade. If strict rules cause errors,
fix the code, not the config.

**Mandatory test & lint infrastructure (every project, no exceptions):**

For JS/TS projects, always generate:
- `eslint.config.js` (flat config) with strict rules appropriate to the framework
- `.prettierrc` + `.prettierignore`
- `tsconfig.json` with `strict: true` if TypeScript
- Test framework config (vitest.config.ts, jest.config.ts, etc.)
- NPM scripts in package.json:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "harness": "tsx scripts/harness.ts",
      "lint": "eslint . --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
      "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix",
      "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
      "test": "vitest run",
      "test:integration": "vitest run tests/integration --passWithNoTests",
      "test:e2e": "vitest run tests/e2e --passWithNoTests",
      "prepare": "husky"
    }
  }
  ```
  (Adapt command prefix to chosen package manager: `pnpm`, `bun`, or `npm run`)

**E2E testing framework (if project has a UI):**

Choose based on project type:
- **Web App (any framework):** Playwright (recommended). Faster, multi-browser, better CI support.
  Install: `<pkg-mgr> add -D @playwright/test` then `npx playwright install`
  Config: `playwright.config.ts` at project root
  Scripts: `"test:e2e": "playwright test"` in package.json
- **Mobile (Expo):** Maestro or Detox. Maestro for flow-level tests, Detox for native interaction.
  Maestro: `.maestro/` directory with YAML flows. No JS dependency.
  Detox: `<pkg-mgr> add -D detox` + device config in `.detoxrc.js`
- **Desktop (Electron):** Playwright with Electron support (`_electron.launch()`).
  Same `@playwright/test` package, test against the packaged app.
- **Desktop (Tauri):** WebDriver-based testing via `tauri-driver` + WebdriverIO.
- **CLI Tool / API / MCP Server:** No E2E framework needed — use integration tests instead.
  API projects: `supertest` or direct HTTP calls in vitest/pytest.

Playwright config template (web apps):
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests/e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: process.env.CI ? 'github' : 'html',
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: '<pkg-mgr> run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

For Python web apps (FastAPI/Django): use `playwright` Python package (`pip install playwright`)
or `pytest-playwright`. Same multi-browser support, Python test syntax.

For Go web apps: use Playwright via `playwright-go` or run Playwright JS tests alongside
the Go backend (start server in CI, run `npx playwright test` against it).

**Harness CLI (every project — see `references/harness-cli.md`):**

Add `tsx` as a dev dependency: `<pkg-mgr> add -D tsx`

Generate the modular CLI structure: `scripts/harness.ts` (thin router, ~50 lines) +
`scripts/harness/` directory with 6 focused modules (config, types, state, worktree,
tasks, validate, quality — each under 350 lines). See `references/harness-cli.md` for
the exact file-by-file implementation. The CLI handles:
- `harness init` → session boot (sync plans, stale check, register agent, print status)
- `harness next` → find next unblocked task (scoped to current worktree's milestone)
- `harness start <id>` → claim task, auto-update progress.json + PLAN.md
- `harness validate` → lint:fix → lint → type-check → test
- `harness validate:full` → + integration/e2e when matching test files exist + file-guard
- `harness done <id>` → complete task, auto-update progress.json + PLAN.md + commit hash
- `harness block <id> <reason>` → mark blocked → 🚫
- `harness reset <id>` → revert task to ⬜ (undo start or unblock)
- `harness learn <cat> <msg>` → log a learning to progress.json + learnings.md
- `harness merge-gate` → full validation + changelog
- `harness worktree:start/finish/rebase/status` → worktree lifecycle + push to remote
- `harness stale-check` / `file-guard` / `schema` / `changelog`
- Any shared harness / CI / template change must be replayed in at least one downstream repo or fixture before it is considered closed

Plus `scripts/check-commit-msg.ts` (needs file path arg, kept separate for hooks).

The CLI uses only `node:` built-in modules — zero external deps beyond `tsx`.
Agent never touches progress.json or PLAN.md manually — the CLI handles all state.

**Non-JS/TS projects (Python, Go, Rust):**
The harness CLI is written in TypeScript and requires `tsx` (Node.js). For non-JS projects:

1. **Recommended:** Install Node.js as a dev dependency (most dev machines already have it).
   Add `scripts/harness.ts` + `scripts/harness/` as-is. The harness CLI manages docs and
   git workflow — it doesn't need to understand the project's source language.
   - Python: `pip install nodeenv && nodeenv .node_env` or just have Node installed globally
   - Go / Rust: Node.js installed alongside Go/Rust toolchain

2. **Alternative (no Node.js):** Use `references/harness-native.md` to generate:
   - `scripts/harness.sh` — shell-based CLI covering init, status, validate, next, start,
     done, block, file-guard, schema, learn. Requires `jq`.
   - `scripts/check-commit-msg.sh` — commit message validator (replaces check-commit-msg.ts)
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (Python/Go) or `.githooks/` (Rust) — replaces husky
   - `.claude/settings.json` adapted for `Bash(bash scripts/harness.sh *)` and
     `Bash(make *)` instead of `Bash(npx tsx scripts/harness.ts *)`
   
   Tradeoff: the native CLI does NOT include worktree management, agent registration,
   plan:apply, merge-gate auto-chain, or scaffold commands. Note this tradeoff in
   AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md. For the full feature set, use option 1.

3. **Validate commands** must be adapted in `scripts/harness/validate.ts` (option 1) or
   the project's Makefile (option 2):
   - Python: `ruff check .` → `ruff check --fix .` → `mypy src/` → `pytest`
   - Go: `golangci-lint run ./...` → `go vet ./...` → `go test -race ./...`
   - Rust: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` → `cargo check` → `cargo test`
   The TypeScript `validate.ts` module runs `${PKG} run lint`, `${PKG} run test`, etc. — it
   delegates to whatever scripts are defined in package.json (JS) or Makefile (non-JS). Make
   sure the project's lint/test/type-check commands are wired up correctly.

**Schemas (included in `references/harness-cli.md`):**

Generate `schemas/progress.schema.json` — validated by `harness schema` command
and by the pre-commit hook.

For Python projects, always generate:
- `ruff.toml` or `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]` config
- `pyproject.toml [tool.mypy]` with strict mode
- pytest config
- Scripts or Makefile: `lint`, `lint-fix`, `type-check`, `test`, `validate`

For Go projects: `golangci-lint` config, `go vet`, `go test ./...`
For Rust projects: `clippy.toml`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`

**The `validate` script is the single gate command.** It runs lint + type-check + tests
in sequence. Agents run this before every commit. CI runs this on every PR.

**Pre-commit hooks (every JS/TS project):**

Generate husky with THREE hooks (see `references/harness-cli.md` for details):

- `.husky/pre-commit` — runs lint-staged + `harness file-guard --staged` + `harness schema`
- `.husky/commit-msg` — runs `check-commit-msg.ts` (rejects non-conforming commits)
- `.husky/pre-push` — runs `harness validate`

`lint-staged` config in package.json:
  ```json
  {
    "lint-staged": {
      "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
      "*.{json,md,yml,yaml}": ["prettier --write"]
    }
  }
  ```
- Setup: `"prepare": "husky"`
- **4-layer enforcement**: pre-commit → commit-msg → pre-push → CI

For Python: use `pre-commit` framework with ruff + mypy hooks.
See `references/harness-native.md` for the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` template.
Install: `uv run pre-commit install` (or `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`).

For Go: use `pre-commit` framework with golangci-lint + go-fmt hooks.
See `references/harness-native.md` for the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` template.

For Rust: use git hooks directly (`.githooks/pre-commit` + `.githooks/commit-msg`).
See `references/harness-native.md` for the hook scripts.
Configure: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

**Claude Code + Codex configuration (every project):**

Generate BOTH config files to enable **autonomous execution** — the agent loops
through tasks without asking permission for routine commands:

Config templates: see `references/project-configs.md` →
- `Claude Code — .claude/settings.json`
- `Codex — .codex/config.toml`

**What this enables:**

- **Claude Code:** The `allowedTools` list pre-approves ALL harness commands, git,
  and the package manager. Commands not on the list still require approval.
- **Codex:** `approval_policy = "never"` + `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` lets
  Codex run all commands within the workspace without prompts.
- **Both:** The agent loops through tasks autonomously. It only pauses at Human
  quality checkpoints (security changes, merge failures, blocked tasks).

The Task Execution Loop runs ~8 shell commands per task. Without pre-approval,
you'd press Y/Enter ~8 times per task. With this config, the agent loops autonomously.

**The user's actual experience:**
```
You:    "Begin working on M1"
Agent:  runs harness init → harness next → harness start → writes code →
        harness validate → git commit → harness done → harness next → ...
        (loops automatically, no permission prompts)
You:    check back whenever you want:
        - <pkg-mgr> run harness status    (cross-platform, recommended)
        - git log --oneline
Agent:  pauses ONLY at Human quality checkpoints:
        - security-sensitive changes
        - merge gate failures
        - blocked tasks (3 validate failures)
        - new module architecture decisions
```

**Why two configs (same outcome, different mechanism):**
- **Claude Code:** uses `allowedTools` whitelist (per-command granularity) + native
  `plansDirectory` for plan mode output
- **Codex:** uses `approval_policy = "never"` (blanket autonomy within sandbox) +
  AGENTS.md instruction for plan file location
- **Windows:** both configs work identically on Windows. All harness commands run
  through `npx tsx` (Node.js) — no bash dependency.

**Non-Node projects using the native shell CLI — `.claude/settings.json`:**
Config template: see `references/project-configs.md` →
`Non-Node variant — .claude/settings.json`.
Add language-specific tools from that section for Python, Go, or Rust projects.

Both agents end up with plan files in the same location → harness init detects and
syncs them identically.

**Environment management (every project):**

Generate one `.env.example` per environment if the user selected multiple environments
(development / staging / production) in Step 4. Each file contains ALL required keys
as placeholder-only values — never real secrets:

```
.env.example              ← base template (always generated)
.env.development.example  ← dev-specific keys (if staging selected)
.env.staging.example      ← staging-specific keys (if staging selected)
.env.production.example   ← production-specific keys (always)
```

Each `.env.example` must comment each variable with where to get it:

```env
# ── Database ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Local: postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/myapp_dev
# Production: get from Railway / Supabase / PlanetScale dashboard
DATABASE_URL=

# ── Auth (Better Auth) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Generate: openssl rand -base64 32
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
# Your server's public URL — used for OAuth callbacks
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# ── OAuth Providers ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Google: console.cloud.google.com → APIs & Services → Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# ── Error tracking ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Sentry: sentry.io → Project Settings → Client Keys (DSN)
SENTRY_DSN=

# ── Feature flags ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
FEATURE_FLAG_KEY=
```

Rules:
- `.gitignore` MUST include `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production` from line one
- `src/lib/env.ts` — typed env loader that validates ALL required vars at startup. Never use `process.env.X` directly in application code — always go through the typed loader
- For mobile (Expo): client-side vars use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix (inlined at build time). Document which vars are public vs server-only in `.env.example`
- Where to set vars in production: document in `docs/PRD.md` or `docs/deployment.md` with links to the relevant platform dashboards (Vercel env → settings page, EAS → eas.json env field or EAS dashboard)

**Env validation implementation by stack:**

JS/TS — use `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` (Next.js) or `@t3-oss/env-core` (other frameworks) + zod:
```typescript
// src/lib/env.ts
import { createEnv } from '@t3-oss/env-core';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
    BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: z.string().min(32),
    NODE_ENV: z.enum(['development', 'production', 'test']).default('development'),
  },
  client: {
    // NEXT_PUBLIC_* or EXPO_PUBLIC_* vars
  },
  runtimeEnv: process.env,
});
```
Install: `<pkg-mgr> add @t3-oss/env-core zod`
Alternative (no framework dependency): plain zod schema + `z.parse(process.env)` at startup.

Python — use `pydantic-settings`:
```python
# src/<package>/config.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    database_url: str
    better_auth_secret: str
    debug: bool = False

    model_config = {"env_file": ".env", "env_file_encoding": "utf-8"}

settings = Settings()  # Validates on import — crashes early if vars missing
```
Install: `uv add pydantic-settings`

Go — use `envconfig` or `env`:
```go
// internal/config/config.go
import "github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig"

type Config struct {
    DatabaseURL string `envconfig:"DATABASE_URL" required:"true"`
    Port        int    `envconfig:"PORT" default:"3000"`
    Debug       bool   `envconfig:"DEBUG" default:"false"`
}

func Load() (*Config, error) {
    var cfg Config
    return &cfg, envconfig.Process("", &cfg)
}
```

Rust — use `envy` or `config`:
```rust
// src/config.rs
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct Config {
    pub database_url: String,
    pub port: u16,
    #[serde(default = "default_false")]
    pub debug: bool,
}
fn default_false() -> bool { false }

impl Config {
    pub fn from_env() -> Result<Self, envy::Error> {
        dotenvy::dotenv().ok();
        envy::from_env()
    }
}
```

**Rule:** The app must crash at startup if required env vars are missing or malformed.
Never silently default a required secret to an empty string.

### Security Hardening Checklist

Generate `docs/security.md` for every project that has a backend, API, or user-facing UI.
The agent should verify these items at every merge-gate. Mark as Human checkpoint if any
are missing.

**Web Application / API — mandatory items:**

Input validation:
- Validate and sanitize ALL user input at the boundary (API route handlers, form handlers)
- Use schema validation (zod, joi, pydantic, etc.) — never trust raw request bodies
- Parameterized queries only — never string-concatenate user input into SQL/NoSQL queries
- File uploads: validate MIME type, enforce size limits, scan if possible

HTTP security headers (generate `src/middleware/security.ts` or equivalent):
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (HSTS)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (unless embedding is intended)
- `Content-Security-Policy` — at minimum `default-src 'self'`; tighten per project needs
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- For JS/TS: use `helmet` middleware (Express/Fastify) — it sets sensible defaults

Authentication & authorization:
- Never store passwords in plaintext — use bcrypt/argon2 with cost factor ≥ 10
- Session tokens: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax (or Strict)
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints (login, signup, password reset)
- CSRF protection for cookie-based auth (SameSite + CSRF token for non-GET mutations)
- JWT: validate signature, check expiry, use short-lived access tokens + refresh rotation

API security:
- CORS: whitelist specific origins — never use `*` in production
- Rate limiting: per-IP and per-user, at minimum on write endpoints
- Request size limits: reject oversized payloads before parsing
- Error responses: never leak stack traces, internal paths, or database details to clients

Secrets management:
- All secrets in env vars — never in code, config files, or logs (Iron Rule 6)
- Rotate secrets: document rotation procedure in `docs/security.md`
- Audit: log access to sensitive operations (auth events, admin actions, data exports)

**Desktop apps (Electron/Tauri) — additional items:**
- Electron: `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`
- Validate all IPC payloads — treat renderer as untrusted
- Auto-updater: verify signatures, use HTTPS-only update feeds
- CSP in renderer: `script-src 'self'` — no inline scripts

**Mobile apps — additional items:**
- Never store secrets in app bundle (`EXPO_PUBLIC_*` is visible to decompilers)
- Use platform secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore via `expo-secure-store`)
- Certificate pinning for production API calls (optional but recommended for financial apps)
- Deep link validation: verify incoming deep link parameters before navigation

**Python/Go/Rust APIs — same principles apply:**
- Python: use `python-multipart` for safe file uploads, `slowapi` or `limits` for rate limiting
- Go: use `net/http` middleware for headers, `golang.org/x/time/rate` for rate limiting
- Rust: use `tower` middleware (Axum) or `actix-web` guards for header injection and rate limiting

The generated `docs/security.md` should include this checklist with checkboxes so the agent
and human can track completion. The agent marks items done during implementation; human reviews
security-sensitive changes at merge-gate.

### progress.json Structure

Always generate `docs/progress.json` with this annotated structure so agents can
read and debug it without guessing:

Field meanings for agents:
- `last_updated`: ISO timestamp, auto-set by CLI on every saveProgress
- `last_agent`: who last modified — `"claude-code"`, `"codex"`, or `"human"`
- `current_milestone`: deprecated singleton snapshot with milestone counters. Keep the field for compatibility, but in parallel-worktree mode the CLI derives the active milestone from the branch instead of trusting this object.
- `current_task`: object for the task currently being worked on, or null
- `status` on a task: `⬜` = not started, `🟡` = in progress (claimed by agent), `✅` = done, `🚫` = blocked
- `depends_on` (task): task IDs that must be ✅ before this task can be started. `harness next` respects this
- `depends_on` (milestone): milestone IDs that must be merged before this milestone can merge. `harness worktree:finish` enforces this
- `worktree`: relative path to the git worktree for this milestone
- `agents`: array of currently active agents — each agent registers on `harness init`, heartbeat updates on every command, stale after 2h
- `finish_jobs`: serialized root-side auto-finish queue state — queued/running/failed/succeeded closeout jobs written by `merge-gate` and `worktree:finish`
- `blockers`: array of blocked tasks with reasons
- `learnings`: array of logged learnings (via `harness learn`)
- `dependency_graph`: task-level dependency map — keys are task IDs, values have `depends_on` and `blocks` arrays
- `synced_plans`: filenames of exec-plans already parsed into PLAN.md



**Docker (for web app / API projects):**

- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage build (build stage + production stage), minimal image
- `docker-compose.yml` — one-command local dev environment:
  ```yaml
  services:
    app:
      build: .
      ports: ["3000:3000"]
      env_file: .env
      volumes: ["./src:/app/src"]  # hot reload
    db:
      image: postgres:16-alpine    # or whatever DB was chosen
      env_file: .env
      ports: ["5432:5432"]
      volumes: ["db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
  volumes:
    db_data:
  ```
- Include `docker-compose up -d` in the Quick Start section of AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md
- Skip Docker for CLI tools and simple libraries unless user requests it

**Error handling infrastructure:**

Generate these files with patterns appropriate to the chosen stack:

- `src/lib/errors.ts` — Unified error class hierarchy:
  - Base `AppError` class with `statusCode`, `code`, `message`, `isOperational`
  - Subclasses: `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `AuthError`, `ConflictError`
  - Error factory function: `createError(code, message, details?)`
  - Every error has a machine-readable `code` (e.g., `AUTH_EXPIRED_TOKEN`)

- `src/lib/logger.ts` — Structured JSON logging:
  - Fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `requestId`, `context`
  - Levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`
  - In dev: pretty-print. In prod: JSON to stdout.
  - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

- `src/middleware/error-handler.ts` — Global error boundary:
  - Catches all unhandled errors
  - Maps AppError subclasses to HTTP status codes
  - Returns consistent error response format:
    `{ error: { code, message, details? } }`
  - Logs error with full context (requestId, stack, user)
  - In dev: includes stack trace. In prod: hides internals.

**Analytics (GA / Posthog — for web apps):**

- `src/lib/analytics.ts` — Analytics service abstraction:
  - `trackEvent(name, properties?)`, `trackPageView(path)`, `identifyUser(id, traits?)`
  - Provider-agnostic interface — swap GA for Posthog without touching app code
  - Loads measurement ID from env (`GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` or `POSTHOG_KEY`)
  - Respects Do Not Track / cookie consent
  - For SSR frameworks (Next.js): handle client-side only initialization
- Include GA/Posthog script setup in the root layout/template

**Health checks & monitoring (for web apps / APIs):**

- `GET /health` endpoint — returns `{ status: "ok", timestamp, version, uptime }`
- `GET /health/ready` — checks DB connection, external service availability
- Sentry integration:
  - `src/lib/sentry.ts` — init from env `SENTRY_DSN`
  - Wraps error handler to auto-report unhandled errors
  - Source maps uploaded in CI (add to deploy workflow)
- These endpoints are the first thing monitoring services hit

**Feature flags:**

- `src/lib/feature-flags.ts` — Feature flag service:
  - Simple local flags for v1: `flags.json` or env-based
  - Interface: `isEnabled(flagName, context?)` → boolean
  - Designed to swap in a remote provider later (LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith, Unleash)
  - Every new user-facing feature gets a flag
  - Flags are the mechanism for gradual rollout — ship to main behind a flag,
    enable for % of users, monitor, then remove flag when stable

**API documentation (for backend projects):**

- OpenAPI/Swagger:
  - Generate `openapi.yaml` or use code-first annotations (e.g., zod-to-openapi)
  - Serve Swagger UI at `/docs` in development
  - Auto-generate from route definitions — never manually maintain the spec
- Storybook (for frontend projects with component libraries):
  - `.storybook/` config
  - One example story for the first component
  - `storybook` script in package.json

**Project documentation site (docs/site/):**

Generate a GitBook-style documentation structure:

- `docs/site/SUMMARY.md` — sidebar navigation / table of contents:
  ```markdown
  # Summary

  - [Introduction](README.md)
  - [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
    - [Installation](getting-started.md#installation)
    - [Configuration](getting-started.md#configuration)
    - [First Run](getting-started.md#first-run)
  - [Architecture](architecture.md)
    - [Domain Map](architecture.md#domain-map)
    - [Dependency Layers](architecture.md#dependency-layers)
  - [API Reference](api-reference.md)
  - [Deployment](deployment.md)
  - [Contributing](contributing.md)
  ```
- `docs/site/README.md` — project introduction, what it does, who it's for
- `docs/site/getting-started.md` — installation, config, first run
- `docs/site/architecture.md` — mirrors ARCHITECTURE.md in user-friendly prose
- `docs/site/api-reference.md` — links to OpenAPI docs or manual reference
- `docs/site/deployment.md` — deploy instructions for chosen platform
- `docs/site/contributing.md` — how to contribute, branch strategy, PR conventions

This structure is compatible with GitBook, Docusaurus, VitePress, or plain markdown
reading. The SUMMARY.md acts as a universal sidebar. Expand pages as the project grows.

**Also include at minimum:**
- Entry point file with a working starter (hello world level)
- One example test that passes
- `.gitignore` — generate from `references/gitignore-templates.md`. Assemble by combining
  the Universal block + the stack-specific block(s). This must be the FIRST file committed
  to the repo, before any code. Verify `.env` patterns are present.
- CI workflows that run `validate` on every PR and `validate:full` + deploy on merge
- `docs/frontend-design.md` — **MUST be generated for every project that has a frontend**.
  Claude Code and Codex cannot access claude.ai skill paths, so the content must be
  bundled into the project repo. Generation strategy — try in order:
  1. Read from the `frontend-design` skill already active in this claude.ai session (preferred).
  2. Read from a local copy: `~/.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` (Linux/macOS) or
     `C:\Users\<user>\.agents\skills\frontend-design\SKILL.md` (Windows).
  3. If neither is reachable, generate a minimal fallback: color palette, typography scale,
     4-point spacing system, component naming conventions, "no generic AI aesthetics" rule.
  Write the result verbatim to `docs/frontend-design.md`. Iron Rule 5 in AGENTS.md /
  CLAUDE.md points to this file. Log the strategy used in `docs/learnings.md`.

For monorepos, generate workspace config (pnpm-workspace.yaml / turbo.json / etc.)
with at least one package or app entry.
