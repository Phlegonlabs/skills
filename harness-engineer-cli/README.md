# Harness Engineer CLI

An agent-first project framework based on Harness Engineering principles.
Works with **Claude Code** and **Codex** on **Windows**, macOS, and Linux.
Skill version: `2026.03.10`

## What it does

Two modes:

- **Greenfield** — New project from scratch. Product discovery → PRD → scaffold → execution.
- **Retrofit** — Existing project. Analyze the codebase, add harness layer on top.

Both modes generate a CLI that agents use to autonomously loop through tasks:
pick → start → code → validate → commit → done → repeat.

- **Node/TS projects** — TypeScript CLI (`scripts/harness.ts` + `scripts/harness/` modules), with full capability: optional managed worktrees, `plan:apply`, and agent lifecycle
- **Strict non-Node projects** (Python/Go/Rust, user explicitly refuses Node) — Shell CLI (`scripts/harness.sh` + `Makefile`), single-agent only: `init` / `status` / `validate` / `next` / `start` / `done` / `block`

> **`references/replay-protocol.md` is for framework-level development only.**
> It documents the SOP for verifying changes to this skill's own reference files across
> downstream fixture repos. It is NOT part of any project's task loop or completion criteria.
> Per-project completion is defined by the Idle Protocol in `references/skill-execution.md`:
> all milestones merged → changelog reviewed → human confirms release tag.

## Top-Level State Machine

The framework has different entry paths, but they all converge into the same runtime loop.
Core rule: chat is input; repo files are state. Execution only proceeds from repo-backed state
such as `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/progress.json`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Entry
  Entry --> Greenfield: new project
  Entry --> Retrofit: existing project
  Entry --> SessionInit: existing harness repo / resumed session

  Greenfield --> ReviewGate: discovery -> PRD -> scaffold
  ReviewGate --> SessionInit: phase-3 review approved

  Retrofit --> RetrofitReview: analyze -> write harness files
  RetrofitReview --> SessionInit: diff / preview approved

  SessionInit --> RuntimeSelect
  RuntimeSelect --> SerialMode: 1 eligible milestone, no isolation need
  RuntimeSelect --> WorktreeMode: parallelism / isolation is beneficial

  SerialMode --> TaskLoop
  WorktreeMode --> TaskLoop
  TaskLoop --> SessionInit: next milestone remains
  TaskLoop --> Idle: all milestones complete

  Idle --> PlanMode: new work
  Idle --> PlanningRecovery: plan exists only in another chat

  PlanMode --> PlanSync: approved plan
  PlanningRecovery --> PlanSync: paste full plan / transcript back
  PlanSync --> ArchitectureSync: system shape changed
  PlanSync --> RuntimeSelect: no architecture change
  ArchitectureSync --> RuntimeSelect
```

- `PlanSync` is mandatory before execution resumes. Do not continue from a chat-only summary.
- `ArchitectureSync` is required when module boundaries, integrations, deployment topology, or core data flow change.
- `WorktreeMode` is conditional, not the default.
- `PlanningRecovery` is the fallback path when planning happened elsewhere and the repo was not synced yet.

## How to install

Add this folder as a skill in claude.ai. The skill triggers when you say things like
"new project", "bootstrap", "scaffold", "add harness to my project", or "retrofit".

## Execution Modes

The generated project supports two execution modes. You choose which one during setup,
and can switch anytime by editing the config files.

### Auto Mode (default)

The agent runs the full task loop without asking permission. It only pauses at
Human quality checkpoints (security changes, merge failures, blocked tasks).

This is the default because the harness CLI + git hooks + CI already enforce all
rules mechanically. The agent can't commit bad code — the hooks reject it.

Config templates for Claude Code and Codex live in `references/project-configs.md`.
Use the `Claude Code — .claude/settings.json` and `Codex — .codex/config.toml` sections
there as the canonical source.

### Menu Mode (supervised)

The agent pauses before every shell command and asks for your approval.
Use this when you want to review each step, or when working on sensitive code.

**To switch Claude Code to Menu Mode:**

Edit `.claude/settings.json` — remove the harness commands from `allowedTools`.

Now the agent will ask "Allow Bash(npx tsx scripts/harness.ts validate)?" before
each command. You press Y to approve or N to skip.

**To switch Codex to Menu Mode:**

Edit `.codex/config.toml` and set `approval_policy = "on-request"`.

Now Codex pauses for every command and waits for your approval.

### Switching between modes

| Want | Claude Code | Codex |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Auto → Menu** | Remove `Bash(...)` entries from `allowedTools` | Change `approval_policy` to `"on-request"` |
| **Menu → Auto** | Add `Bash(...)` entries back to `allowedTools` | Change `approval_policy` to `"never"` |

Changes take effect on the next agent session. No restart needed — just start a new session.

### When to use which

| Situation | Recommended mode |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Routine feature work | Auto |
| First time using the harness | Menu (to see what the agent does) |
| Security-sensitive code | Menu |
| Unfamiliar codebase (retrofit) | Menu for first milestone, then Auto |
| Parallel agents on multiple milestones | Auto |
| Debugging a blocked task | Menu |

```

Execution start rule:
- Default serial path: run `harness init` from main/root when there is one eligible milestone, one active agent, and no explicit isolation need.
- Managed worktree path: run `harness worktree:start <M-id>` only when 2+ milestones can run in parallel or milestone isolation is beneficial.
- Retrofit / plan-mode handoff: sync the plan into `docs/PLAN.md` and `docs/progress.json` before leaving planning; `init` auto-`plan:apply` is recovery, not the primary ingest path.
- Architecture sync in planning: if the approved plan changes module boundaries, integrations, deployment topology, or core data flow, update `ARCHITECTURE.md` before leaving planning and sync `docs/gitbook/architecture.md` when present.
- Planning fallback: if planning already happened in another chat or the session exited before sync, paste the full approved plan output or transcript back into the current session, reconstruct `docs/exec-plans/active/*.md`, then immediately sync `docs/PLAN.md` + `docs/progress.json` and any architecture doc changes.

## Requirements

**Node/TS projects (TypeScript CLI):**
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- One of: pnpm, bun, or npm. For Expo / EAS projects, `yarn` is also supported and is often preferable for monorepos.
- `tsx` (added automatically as a dev dependency)

**Strict non-Node projects (Shell CLI fallback — Python, Go, Rust):**
- Git
- `jq` (JSON processor — for `scripts/harness.sh`)
- `bash` 4+ (macOS ships bash 3; install bash via Homebrew if needed)
- Language runtime: Python 3.11+ / Go 1.22+ / Rust stable
- No Node.js or npm required — the shell CLI handles the single-agent task loop only
- Windows note: prefer the TypeScript CLI on native Windows. The shell CLI requires Git Bash or WSL because it uses POSIX shell utilities.

## Upgrade And Rollback

- `harness migrate` only backfills harness-managed runtime folders, schema files, and missing runtime fields. It does not rewrite `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or workflow prose.
- If a merged milestone must be undone, use `git revert` on the merge commit, then manually reconcile `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/progress.json`, and any archived exec-plan files. The harness does not provide a `revert-merge` command yet.

## Version Update Shortcut

From repo root:

```bash
pwsh scripts/bump-version.ps1            # set version to today's date (YYYY.MM.DD)
pwsh scripts/bump-version.ps1 -Version 2026.03.11  # explicit version
```

This updates:

- `VERSION`
- `SKILL.md` (frontmatter `version`)
- `README.md` (`Skill version`)

## Self-Iteration + Self-Correction

When you detect a workflow/process drift (commands changed, duplicated docs, wrong
template source, etc.):

```bash
pwsh scripts/skill-maintenance.ps1                  # full health check only
pwsh scripts/skill-maintenance.ps1 -AutoFix         # run safe self-corrections
pwsh scripts/skill-maintenance.ps1 -AutoFix -Version 2026.03.12  # optional explicit version sync
```

Every run of `bump-version.ps1` and every `-AutoFix` run appends an entry to
`SKILL-AUDIT.md` — review it to trace what changed and why.

Recommended loop:

1. Run maintenance check.
2. Fix any failures manually.
3. Re-run with `-AutoFix` to sync obvious drift.
4. Re-run check to verify the process contract is closed again.

## Validation Strategy

This repo is a doc-first skill bundle, so template changes should be verified by replaying them
into representative fixture outputs or downstream repos before being treated as done.

Recommended minimum replay matrix:

- Web app, single-package TypeScript scaffold
- Desktop app scaffold (`Electron` or `Tauri`)
- Mixed-language monorepo (`apps/web` in TS + backend in Python, Go, or Rust)

Snapshot or diff at least these generated artifacts:

- `docs/PLAN.md`
- `docs/progress.json`
- `schemas/progress.schema.json`
- `scripts/harness.ts` and `scripts/harness/`
- Stack-native manifests such as `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.work`, and `Cargo.toml`

If the change touches harness runtime behavior, CI, or generated workflow rules, replay it in at
least one real downstream project or fixture repo and confirm the generated project still passes
`harness validate`.
